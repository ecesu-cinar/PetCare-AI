# PetCare AI: Enhancing Pet-Owner Communication through Artificial Intelligence üêæ

Final project for the **Building AI** course by **Reaktor Innovations** and **University of Helsinki**.

## Summary

**PetCare AI** is an innovative application designed to bridge the communication gap between pets and their owners. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence techniques, the system analyzes pet behaviors‚Äîsuch as sounds and movements‚Äîto provide real-time insights into their emotional and physical states, thereby promoting better understanding and care.

## Background

Understanding pet behavior is a common challenge among pet owners, leading to misinterpretations that can affect the well-being of both pets and their owners. This project addresses:

- **Communication Gap:** Deciphering what different barks, meows, or movements signify.
- **Health Monitoring:** Early detection of potential health issues through behavioral analysis.
- **Strengthening Bonds:** Enhancing the relationship between pets and owners by fostering better understanding.
